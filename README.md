In this challenge, we were tasked with a list of acceptance criteria (featured below this section) that would allow/guide us to making the first version of our portfolio page.

* We would use HTML and Responsive CSS criteria
* Create a unique design showcasing blocks to put our biography and future class work
* Layout will shift depending on the size of the window it's being viewed from
* Navigation takes you to different pages or components within the same page

This project wasn't given starter code. I have provided one screenshot of the @mediascreen option to showcase how the responsiveness within css alone was changed and have commented within the code how it's seperated.


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
